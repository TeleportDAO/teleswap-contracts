You can't index ranges effectively\\n    // 2. You can't slice without copying\\n    // 3. The underlying data may represent any type\\n    // 4. Solidity never deallocates memory, and memory costs grow\\n    //    superlinearly\\n\\n    // By using a memory view instead of a `bytes memory` we get the following\\n    // advantages:\\n    // 1. Slices are done on the stack, by manipulating the pointer\\n    // 2. We can index arbitrary ranges and quickly convert them to stack types\\n    // 3. We can insert type info into the pointer, and typecheck at runtime\\n\\n    // This makes `TypedMemView` a useful tool for efficient zero-copy\\n    // algorithms.\\n\\n    // Why bytes29?\\n    // We want to avoid confusion between views, digests, and other common\\n    // types so we chose a large and uncommonly used odd number of bytes\\n    //\\n    // Note that while bytes are left-aligned in a word, integers and addresses\\n    // are right-aligned. This means when working in assembly we have to\\n    // account for the 3 unused bytes on the righthand side\\n    //\\n    // First 5 bytes are a type flag.\\n    // - ff_ffff_fffe is reserved for unknown type.\\n    // - ff_ffff_ffff is reserved for invalid types/errors.\\n    // next 12 are memory address\\n    // next 12 are len\\n    // bottom 3 bytes are empty\\n\\n    // Assumptions:\\n    // - non-modification of memory.\\n    // - No Solidity updates\\n    // - - wrt free mem point\\n    // - - wrt bytes representation in memory\\n    // - - wrt memory addressing in general\\n\\n    // Usage:\\n    // - create type constants\\n    // - use `assertType` for runtime type assertions\\n    // - - unfortunately we can't do this at compile time yet :(\\n    // - recommended: implement modifiers that perform type checking\\n    // - - e.g.\\n    // - - `uint40 constant MY_TYPE = 3;`\\n    // - - ` modifer onlyMyType(bytes29 myView) { myView.assertType(MY_TYPE);
